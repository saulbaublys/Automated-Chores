# Automated-Chores
Program that automates the assignment and notification of chores.

This program reads in the users and the chores, then randomly assigns a chore to each member.It then proceeds to send out text messages to the users with their chores. An email address as well as a SMTP server are required. 

The number of chores MUST be the same as the number of members. 

The format of the members and chores files are displayed in the pdf's in the repository.
